# MarylandZoo
This project is dedicated to addressing a specific challenge posed by the Maryland Zoo: enhancing the “chase” component in the hunting behavior of captive bobcats. While current enrichment methods at the zoo effectively cover the "seek" and "kill" phases of the hunting process, they fall short in stimulating the vital "chase" aspect that is innate in wild bobcats. Our goal is to bridge this gap, aiming to enhance bobcats' mental and physical stimulation by replicating their natural hunting behaviors more comprehensively.
The primary beneficiaries of such an enrichment solution are the Maryland Zoo’s zookeepers and animal care staff, who will be responsible for introducing and maintaining the enrichment system. Additionally, the captive bobcats themselves stand to benefit significantly from more engaging and naturalistic daily enrichment activities.
In developing this solution, the project will work within the guidelines set forth by the zookeeper and veterinarian staff. This includes working within the constraints of safe and durable materials, avoiding the introduction of unfamiliar foods into the current diet, and acknowledging limitations in data collection regarding bobcat behavior. Some other considerations include exploring the potential to extend the feeding routines into nighttime hours, thereby allowing bobcats to engage in hunting activities beyond typical operating times. Ensuring the safety and well-being of both the bobcats and zookeepers remains our top priority throughout the ideation and development process.
